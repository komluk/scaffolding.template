# OpenSpec Workflow Orchestration

Spec-driven development protocol for coordinating multi-agent workflows.

## UUID Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: The `conversation_id` MUST always be a UUID (format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`). NEVER use descriptive names, slugs, or human-readable strings. If no UUID is available, generate one with `uuidgen` or `python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`. Self-check: does the conversation_id match the pattern `[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}`? If not, STOP and use a real UUID.

## Directory Structure

```
.scaffolding/conversations/{conversation_id}/specs/
  proposal.md   -- WHY + WHAT (analyst)
  design.md     -- WHAT + HOW (architect)
  tasks.md      -- checklist (architect)
```

## Status Lifecycle

Tracked in `.scaffolding/conversations/{conversation_id}/context.json`:

| Status | Meaning | Transition |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `exploring` | Research phase | -> `drafting` when proposal done |
| `drafting` | Design + tasks | -> `implementing` when tasks done |
| `implementing` | Code changes | -> `reviewing` when tasks complete |
| `reviewing` | Verification | -> `complete` when verified |
| `complete` | Done | -> `archived` on request |
| `archived` | Historical | Terminal state |

## Agent Routing in /workflow

| Phase | Agent | Reads | Writes | Gate |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|------|
| 1. Analyze | analyst | requirements | `proposal.md` | proposal written |
| 1b. Research (conditional) | researcher | requirements | ResearchPack | score >= 80 |
| 2. Design | architect | `proposal.md` | `design.md`, `tasks.md` | score >= 85 |
| 3. Apply | developer | `tasks.md`, `design.md` | source code | validation passes |
| 4. Verify | reviewer | `design.md`, `tasks.md` | review report | no criticals |

## When Researcher Is Needed

Analyst flags need for research in proposal.md. Researcher is invoked ONLY when the task involves:
- New external API integration (e.g., Stripe, Twilio)
- Unfamiliar library not yet in the project
- Best practices requiring current internet research
- Version-specific documentation for upgrades/migrations

Analyst writes proposal directly (no researcher) for:
- Internal codebase refactoring
- UI/styling changes
- Bug fixes with known root cause
- Configuration changes
- Features using only existing project dependencies

## When to Create vs Skip Specs

| Task Type | Use Specs? | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| New feature | Yes | Needs design, multi-file |
| Architecture change | Yes | Needs decisions documented |
| Multi-agent workflow | Yes | Needs coordination |
| Bug fix (simple) | No | Direct to developer |
| Typo / config tweak | No | Direct to developer |
| Single-file refactor | No | Direct to developer |

## Orchestration Steps

1. **Obtain conversation_id UUID**: From prompt context or generate via `uuidgen`. **MUST be a UUID, never a descriptive name.**
2. **Create specs directory**: `mkdir -p .scaffolding/conversations/{conversation_id}/specs/`
3. **Set specs_path**: `.scaffolding/conversations/{conversation_id}/specs/`
4. **Analyst writes proposal.md** (requirements, scope, impact, feasibility)
5. **If research needed**: analyst flags in proposal.md, researcher is invoked (score >= 80)
6. **Architect writes design.md + tasks.md** (incorporating proposal.md and ResearchPack if available)
7. **Pass specs_path** in every agent delegation prompt
8. **Update context.json** status after each phase transition
9. **Gate enforcement**: Block next phase if quality gate fails

## Context JSON Schema

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "abc-123",
  "status": "implementing",
  "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "description": "Feature description",
  "agents_involved": ["architect", "developer"]
}
```
