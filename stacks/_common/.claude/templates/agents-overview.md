# Specialized Agents Overview

The agent system comprises **10 specialized agents** organized across three operational tiers.

## Tier 1: Orchestration (2 Agents)

### analyst
Requirements analyst for ambiguous requests. Interprets user intent, decomposes requirements, writes proposal.md, performs scope assessment and feasibility checks. Routes to the correct downstream agent.

**Triggers**: Ambiguous requests, requirements gathering, scope assessment, feasibility checks, proposal writing
**Tools**: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Write
**Output**: proposal.md with requirements, acceptance criteria, impact assessment

### architect
Master coordinator for complex, multi-faceted projects. Decomposes requirements into subtasks, designs architecture and APIs, coordinates multi-agent workflows. Also handles implementation planning: transforms ResearchPacks into executable implementation plans with minimal changes, reversibility, and clear steps.

**Triggers**: Complex features, refactoring, multi-file changes, architecture questions, task routing, API design, implementation planning
**Tools**: Read, Glob, Grep, Task, WebSearch
**Output**: Task breakdown, agent assignments, dependency graph, API specifications, ImplementationPlan with file list, steps, rollback strategy
**Quality Gate (planning)**: Score >= 85 to proceed to implementation

## Tier 2: Core Development (4 Agents)

### researcher
Retrieves accurate, version-specific documentation for APIs and libraries. Searches official docs, verifies accuracy, produces ResearchPacks with citations.

**Triggers**: New API integration, library questions, best practices lookup
**Tools**: WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Glob, Grep
**Output**: ResearchPack with sources and confidence levels
**Quality Gate**: Score >= 80 to proceed to planning

### developer
Expert software engineer. Implements features, fixes bugs, writes all tests (unit, integration, E2E), implements UI/styling. Primary agent for all coding tasks.

**Triggers**: Implementation tasks, bug fixes, feature development, testing, UI/styling
**Tools**: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep
**Output**: Working code, tests, validation results
**Quality Gate**: `npm run validate` or `pytest` passes

### debugger
Systematic root cause analysis for bugs and issues. Uses progressive debugging techniques from quick checks to deep analysis.

**Triggers**: Bug reports, unexpected behavior, errors
**Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
**Output**: Root cause analysis, fix recommendations

### reviewer
Comprehensive code review and security specialist. Handles all review types: quality, security, performance, test coverage. Also performs threat modeling and compliance review.

**Triggers**: After code changes, before commit, security analysis, threat modeling
**Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebSearch
**Output**: Review report with findings, security analysis, STRIDE assessment
**Commands**: /code-review, /security-review, /test-coverage

## Tier 3: Specialized (3 Agents)

### performance-optimizer
Performance and database specialist. Handles profiling, benchmarking, query optimization, schema design, migrations, and bottleneck identification.

**Triggers**: Performance issues, database design, schema changes, migration planning, query optimization
**Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
**Output**: Performance analysis, schema design, migration plan, optimization recommendations

### tech-writer
Documentation owner. Manages ALL markdown files: README, CHANGELOG, docs/. Sole authority for documentation.

**Triggers**: Documentation updates, CHANGELOG entries
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob
**Output**: Updated documentation files

### devops
CI/CD and infrastructure specialist. Manages pipelines, deployment, environment setup.

**Triggers**: CI/CD changes, deployment, infrastructure
**Tools**: Bash, Read, Write, Edit
**Output**: Pipeline configurations, deployment scripts
