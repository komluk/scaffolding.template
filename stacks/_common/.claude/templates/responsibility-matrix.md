# Agent Responsibility Matrix

Clear ownership assignments to prevent overlap and confusion.

## Quality Gates

## Summary: All 11 Agents

| Agent | Primary Focus | Does NOT Do |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **analyst** | Requirements, scope, feasibility, proposals | Code changes, design |
| **architect** | Task routing, orchestration, architecture, API design, implementation planning | Code changes |
| **coordinator** | Dynamic task decomposition into agent step plans | Code changes |
| **researcher** | Documentation research | Planning, coding |
| **developer** | Write code, all tests, UI/styling | Docs, architecture |
| **debugger** | Root cause analysis | Fix implementation |
| **reviewer** | All reviews, security, threat modeling | Writing code |
| **optimizer** | Performance, database design, queries | Code changes |
| **tech-writer** | All documentation | Code changes |
| **devops** | CI/CD, infrastructure | Feature implementation |
| **gitops** | Branch management, commit/merge/push, worktree recovery | Feature implementation |

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns Ownership

| Concern | Design Owner | Review Owner | Implementation |
|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Error handling | architect | reviewer | developer |
| Logging | architect | reviewer | developer |
| Security | reviewer | reviewer | developer |
| Performance | optimizer | reviewer | developer |
| Database | optimizer | reviewer | developer |
| API design | architect | reviewer | developer |

---

## Conflict Resolution

When agents disagree:
1. **Architecture vs Performance**: architect decides, optimizer advises
2. **Security vs Usability**: reviewer decides with user input
3. **Speed vs Quality**: reviewer enforces quality gates
